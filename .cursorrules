# Shell Preferences

- Always use PowerShell for command execution

- Prefer .ps1 scripts over direct terminal commands

- Enforce PowerShell 7+ compatibility
 
# Command Handling

- Wrap multi-step operations in script files

- Use full paths for executables (e.g., C:\Program Files\...)

- Include error handling in all scripts:

  - `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`

  - `try/catch` blocks for critical operations
